- I used Bootstrapâ€™s grid system so the product cards fit nicely on big screens and stack one under another on small screens.
- Each product is inside a simple Bootstrap card for a clean and easy-to-read look.
- The images and text adjust automatically so everything stays neat on phones, tablets and computers.
